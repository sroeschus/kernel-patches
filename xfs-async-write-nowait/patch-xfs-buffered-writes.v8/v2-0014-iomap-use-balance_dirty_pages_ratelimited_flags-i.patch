Subject: [RFC PATCH v2 14/16] iomap: use balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_flags
 in iomap_write_iter

This replaces the call to balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited() with the
call to balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_flags. This allows to specify if
the write request is async or not.

In addition this also moves the above function call to the beginning of
the function. If the function call is at the end of the function and the
decision is made to throttle writes, then there is no request that
io-uring can wait on. By moving it to the beginning of the function, the
write request is not issued, but returns -EAGAIN instead. io-uring will
punt the request and process it in the io-worker.

By moving the function call to the beginning of the function, the write
throttling will happen one page later.
