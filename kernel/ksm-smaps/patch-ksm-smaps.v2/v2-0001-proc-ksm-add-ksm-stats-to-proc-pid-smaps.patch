Subject: [PATCH v2] proc/ksm: add ksm stats to /proc/pid/smaps

With madvise and prctl KSM can be enabled for different VMA's. Once it
is enabled we can query how effective KSM is overall. However we cannot
easily query if an individual VMA benefits from KSM.

This commit adds a KSM section to the /prod/<pid>/smaps file. It reports
how many of the pages are KSM pages.

Here is a typical output:

This information also helps with the following workflow:
- First enable KSM for all the VMA's of a process with prctl.
- Then analyze with the above smaps report which VMA's benefit the most
- Change the application (if possible) to add the corresponding madvise
calls for the VMA's that benefit the most
