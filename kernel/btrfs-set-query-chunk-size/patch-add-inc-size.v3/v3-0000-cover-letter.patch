Subject: [PATCH v3 0/4] btrfs: sysfs: set / query btrfs chunk size

Motivation:
The btrfs allocator is currently not ideal for all workloads. It tends
to suffer from overallocating data block groups and underallocating
metadata block groups. This results in filesystems becoming read-only
even though there is plenty of "free" space.

This is naturally confusing and distressing to users.

Patches:
1) Store the chunk size in the btrfs_space_info structure
2) Add a sysfs entry to read/write the chunk size 
3) Add a sysfs entry to force a space allocation
4) Increase the default size of the metadata chunk allocation to 5GB
   for volumes greater than 50GB.

Testing:
  A new test is being added to the xfstest suite. For reference the
  corresponding patch has the title:
    [PATCH] btrfs: Test chunk allocation with different sizes

  In addition also manual testing has been performed.
    - Run xfstests with the changes and the new test. It does not
      show new diffs.
    - Test with storage devices 10G, 20G, 30G, 50G, 60G
      - Default allocation
      - Increase of chunk size
      - If the stripe size is > the free space, it allocates
        free space - 1MB. The 1MB is left as free space.
      - If the device has a storage size > 50G, it uses a 5GB
        chunk size for new allocations.

Stefan Roesch (4):
  btrfs: store chunk size in space-info struct.
  btrfs: expose chunk size in sysfs.
  btrfs: add force_chunk_alloc sysfs entry to force allocation
  btrfs: increase metadata alloc size to 5GB for volumes > 50GB

    - Use stripe_size = chunk_size

V2:
   - Split the patch in 4 patches
   - Added checks for zone volumes in sysfs.c
   - Replaced the BUG() with ASSERT()
