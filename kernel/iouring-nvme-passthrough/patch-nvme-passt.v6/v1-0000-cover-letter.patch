Subject: [PATCH v1 00/11] add large CQE support for io-uring

This adds the large CQE support for io-uring. Large CQE's are 16 bytes longer.
To support the longer CQE's the allocation part is changed and when the CQE is
accessed.

The allocation of the large CQE's is twice as big, so the allocation size is
doubled. The ring size calculation needs to take this into account.

All accesses to the large CQE's need to be shifted by 1 to take the bigger size
of each CQE into account. The existing index manipulation does not need to be
changed and can stay the same.

The setup and the completion processing needs to take the new fields into
account and initialize them. For the completion processing these fields need
to be passed through.

The flush completion processing needs to fill the additional CQE32 fields.

The code for overflows needs to be adapted accordingly: the allocation needs to
take large CQE's into account. This means that the order of the fields in the io
overflow structure needs to be changed and the allocation needs to be enlarged
for big CQE's.
In addition the two new fields need to be copied for large CQE's.

The new fields are added to the tracing statements, so the extra1 and extra2
fields are exposed in tracing.

For testing purposes the extra1 and extra2 fields are used by the nop operation.


Testing:

The exisiting tests have been run with the following configurations and they all
pass:

- Default config
- Large SQE
- Large CQE
- Large SQE and large CQE.

In addition a new test has been added to liburing to verify that extra1 and extra2
are set as expected for the nop operation.

Note:
To use this patch also the corresponding changes to the client library
liburing are required. A different patch series is sent out for this.

This is based of the jens/io_uring-big-sqe branch.
