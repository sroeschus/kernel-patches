+Description:
+	Under normal circumstances each device is given a part of the
+	total write-back cache that relates to its current average
+	writeout speed in relation to the other devices.
+
+	The 'min_ratio_fine' parameter allows assigning a minimum reserve
+	of the write-back cache to a particular device. The value is
+    expressed as part of 1 million. For example, this is useful for
+    providing a minimum QoS.
