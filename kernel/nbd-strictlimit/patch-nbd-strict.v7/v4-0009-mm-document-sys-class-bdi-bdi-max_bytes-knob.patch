+Description:
+	Allows limiting a particular device to use not more than the
+	given 'max_bytes' of the write-back cache.  This is useful in
+	situations where we want to avoid one device taking all or
+	most of the write-back cache.  For example in case of an NFS
+	mount that is prone to get stuck, a FUSE mount which cannot be
+	trusted to play fair, or a nbd device.
