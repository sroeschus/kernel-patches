Subject: [PATCH v4 0/1] io-uring: Make statx api stable 

One of the key architectual tenets of io-uring is to keep the
parameters for io-uring stable. After the call has been submitted,
its value can be changed.  Unfortunaltely this is not the case for
the current statx implementation.

Patch:
 Part 1: fs: replace const char* parameter in vfs_statx and do_statx with
          struct filename
   Create filename object outside of do_statx and vfs_statx, so io-uring
   can create the filename object during the prepare phase

 Part 2: io-uring: Copy path name during prepare stage for statx
   Create and store filename object during prepare phase


There is also a patch for the liburing libray to add a new test case. This
patch makes sure that the api is stable.
  "liburing: add test for stable statx api"

The patch has been tested with the liburing test suite and fstests.


Changes:
V2: don't check name in vfs_fstatat
V3: don't check name in statx syscall
V4: - incorporate Steven Rostedt's fix
    - Merge both patches to avoid bisect problem
      (the io-uring changes have a dependency on the parameter change in
       the fs layer)
