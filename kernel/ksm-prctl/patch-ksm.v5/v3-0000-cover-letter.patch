Subject: [PATCH v3 0/3] mm: process/cgroup ksm support

So far KSM can only be enabled by calling madvise for memory regions. To
be able to use KSM for more workloads, KSM needs to have the ability to be
enabled / disabled at the process / cgroup level.

Use case 1:
The madvise call is not available in the programming language. An example for
this are programs with forked workloads using a garbage collected language without
pointers. In such a language madvise cannot be made available.

In addition the addresses of objects get moved around as they are garbage
collected. KSM sharing needs to be enabled "from the outside" for these type of
workloads.

Use case 2:
The same interpreter can also be used for workloads where KSM brings no
benefit or even has overhead. We'd like to be able to enable KSM on a workload
by workload basis.

Use case 3:
With the madvise call sharing opportunities are only enabled for the current
process: it is a workload-local decision. A considerable number of sharing
opportuniites may exist across multiple workloads or jobs. Only a higler level
entity like a job scheduler or container can know for certain if its running
one or more instances of a job. That job scheduler however doesn't have
the necessary internal worklaod knowledge to make targeted madvise calls.

Security concerns:
In previous discussions security concerns have been brought up. The problem is
that an individual workload does not have the knowledge about what else is
running on a machine. Therefore it has to be very conservative in what memory
areas can be shared or not. However, if the system is dedicated to running
multiple jobs within the same security domain, its the job scheduler that has
the knowledge that sharing can be safely enabled and is even desirable.

Performance:
Experiments with using UKSM have shown a capacity increase of around 20%.


1. New options for prctl system command
This patch series adds two new options to the prctl system call. The first
one allows to enable KSM at the process level and the second one to query the
setting.

The setting will be inherited by child processes.

With the above setting, KSM can be enabled for the seed process of a cgroup
and all processes in the cgroup will inherit the setting.

2. Changes to KSM processing
When KSM is enabled at the process level, the KSM code will iterate over all
the VMA's and enable KSM for the eligible VMA's.

When forking a process that has KSM enabled, the setting will be inherited by
the new child process.

In addition when KSM is disabled for a process, KSM will be disabled for the
VMA's where KSM has been enabled.

3. Add general_profit metric
The general_profit metric of KSM is specified in the documentation, but not
calculated. This adds the general profit metric to /sys/kernel/debug/mm/ksm.

4. Add more metrics to ksm_stat
This adds the process profit and ksm type metric to /proc/<pid>/ksm_stat.

5. Add more tests to ksm_tests
This adds an option to specify the merge type to the ksm_tests. This allows to
test madvise and prctl KSM. It also adds a new option to query if prctl KSM has
been enabled. It adds a fork test to verify that the KSM process setting is
inherited by client processes.
