Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] io_uring: add getdents64 support

This series adds support for getdents64 in liburing. The intent is to
provide a more complete I/O interface for io_uring.

Patch 1: fs: add parameter use_fpos to iterate_dir()
  This adds a new parameter to the function iterate_dir() so the
  caller can specify if the position is the file position or the
  position stored in the buffer context.

Patch 2: fs: split off vfs_getdents function from getdents64 system call
  This splits of the iterate_dir part of the syscall in its own
  dedicated function. This allows to call the function directly from
  liburing.

Patch 3: io_uring: add support for getdents64
  Adds the functions to io_uring to support getdents64.

There is also a patch series for the changes to liburing. This includes
a new test. The patch series is called "liburing: add getdents support."

The following tests have been performed:
- new liburing getdents test program has been run
- xfstests have been run
- both tests have been repeated with the kernel memory leak checker
  and no leaks have been reported.
