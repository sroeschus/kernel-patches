+Advisor
+=======
+
+The advisor can be used so KSM can automatically adapt to changes in the number
+of candidate pages to scan. Two advisors are implemented: 0 (None) and 1 (Scan
+time). With None no advisor is implemented. The default is None.
+
+The Scan time advisor changes the ``pages_to_scan`` parameter based on previous
+scan times. The possible values for the ``pages_to_scan`` parameter is limited
+by the ``advisor_min_pages`` and ``advisor_max_pages`` parameters. In addition
+there is also the ``advisor_target_scan_time`` parameter. This parameter sets the
+target time to scan all the KSM candidate pages. ``advisor_target_scan_time``
+decides how aggressive the scan time advisor scans candidate pages. Lower values
+make the scan time advisor to scan more aggresively.
+
+The ``pages_to_scan`` is only changed after a scan has been completed.
+
+The above mentioned parameters are defined under /sys/kernel/mm/ksm.
