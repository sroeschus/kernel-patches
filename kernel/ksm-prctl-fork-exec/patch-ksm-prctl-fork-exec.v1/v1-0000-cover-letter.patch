Subject: [PATCH v1 0/2] mm/ksm: add fork-exec support for prctl

A process can enable KSM with the prctl system call. When the process is
forked the KSM flag is inherited by the child process. However if the
process is executing an exec system call directly after the fork, the
KSM setting is cleared. This patch series addresses this problem.

1) Change the mask in coredump.h for execing a new process
2) Add a new test program in ksm_functional_tests
