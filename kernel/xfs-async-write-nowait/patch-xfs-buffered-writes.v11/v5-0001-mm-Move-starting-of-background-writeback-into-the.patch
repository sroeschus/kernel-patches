Subject: [PATCH v5 01/16] mm: Move starting of background writeback into the
 main balancing loop

We start background writeback if we are over background threshold after
exiting the main loop in balance_dirty_pages(). This may result in
basing the decision on already stale values (we may have slept for
significant amount of time) and it is also inconvenient for refactoring
needed for async dirty throttling. Move the check into the main waiting
loop.
