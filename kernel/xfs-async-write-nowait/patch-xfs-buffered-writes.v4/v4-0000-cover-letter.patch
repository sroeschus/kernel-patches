Subject: [RFC PATCH v4 00/17] io-uring/xfs: support async buffered writes

This patch series adds support for async buffered writes when using both
xfs io-uring. Currently io-uring only supports buffered writes in the slow
path, by processing them in the io workers. With this patch series it is
now possible to support buffered writes in the fast path. To be able to use
the fast path the required pages must be in the page cache. The required locks
in xfs can be granted immediately and no additional blocks need to be read
form disk.

Open issues:
- Updating the modified time of the inode takes time.
  Updating the inode can take time. Patch 15 implements an
  improvement for that. However for 300 write requests only 120 are
  able to take the fast path.
  
- Updating the modified time of the inode blocks other requests.
  Updating the last modified time of the inode keeps the inode locked
  in exclusive mode. This has the side effect that new requests cannot
  get the inode lock in no_wait and therefore get punted to the io worker.

Alternative 1:
  Don't implement any special case for the above updating of the modified time
  and let it proceed in the fast path.

  Potentially pass down no_wait information to function xfs_vn_update_time() and
  get ilock in nowait there. We still wouldn't get the allocations atomic, but
  most of the allocations use a cache.

Alternative 2:
  Increase the granularity how often the modification time is updated.


Support for async buffered writes:

  Patch 1: block: add check for async buffered writes to generic_write_checks
    Add a new flag FMODE_BUF_WASYNC so filesystems can specify that they support
    async buffered writes and include the flag in the check of the function
    generic_write_checks().
    
  Patch 2: mm: add FGP_ATOMIC flag to __filemap_get_folio()
    This adds the FGP_ATOMIC flag. This allows to specify the gfp flags
    for memory allocations for async buffered writes.
    
  Patch 3: iomap: add iomap_page_create_gfp to allocate iomap_pages
    Add new function to allow specifying gfp flags when allocating and
    initializing the structure iomap_page.

  Patch 4: iomap: add async buffered write support
    Set IOMAP_NOWAIT flag if IOCB_NOWAIT is set. Also use specific gfp flags if
    the iomap_page structure is allocated for an async buffered page.

  Patch 5: xfs: add iomap async buffered write support
    Add async buffered write support to the xfs iomap layer.

  Patch 6: xfs: add async buffered write support
    Take the ilock in nowait mode if async buffered writes are enabled.

  Patch 7: io_uring: add support for async buffered writes
    This enables the async buffered writes optimization in io_uring.
    Buffered writes are enabled for blocks that are already in the page
    cache.

  Patch 8: io_uring: Add tracepoint for short writes

Support for write throttling of async buffered writes:

  Patch 9: sched: add new fields to task_struct
    Add two new fields to the task_struct. These fields store the
    deadline after which writes are no longer throttled.

  Patch 10: mm: support write throttling for async buffered writes
    This changes the balance_dirty_pages function to take an additional
    parameter. When nowait is specified the write throttling code no
    longer waits synchronously for the deadline to expire. Instead
    it sets the fields in task_struct. Once the deadline expires the
    fields are reset.
    
  Patch 11: iomap: User throttling for async buffered writes.
    Enable async buffered write throttling in iomap.

  Patch 12: io_uring: support write throttling for async buffered writes
    Adds support to io_uring for write throttling. When the writes
    are throttled, the write requests are added to the pending io list.
    Once the write throttling deadline expires, the writes are submitted.

Support for async buffered write support and suid/guid check

  Patch 13: fs: split off file_remove_privs_int() from file_remove_privs()
    Split off function file_remove_privs_int() with new no_wait parameter.
    If this file with suid/sgid bits enabled, no wait processing is disabled.
    It also splits the check and the action part in two functions.
    
Support for async buffered write support and inode time modification

  Patch 14: fs: split of do_file_update_time from file_update_time
    Split of the doc_file_update_time function so a no_wait parameter
    can be added to the function.
    
  Patch 15: fs: add no_wait parameter to file_modified()
    Add no_wait parameter to the file_modified function, so async buffered
    writes can be supported.
    
  Patch 16: fs: add flag I_PENDING_TIME to inode
    Add new flag so consecutive write requests for the same inode can
    proceed without waiting for the inode modification time to complete.

Enable async buffered write support in xfs
  Patch 17: xfs: enable async buffered write support
    This enables the flag that enables async buffered writes for xfs.


Testing:
  This patch has been tested with xfstests and fio.


Updates:
- V3: - Add changes for inode time modification
