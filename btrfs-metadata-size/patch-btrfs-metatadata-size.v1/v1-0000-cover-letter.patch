Subject: [PATCH v1 0/3] btrfs: add sysfs switch to get/set metadata size

The btrfs allocator is currently not ideal for all workloads. It tends
to suffer from overallocating data block groups and underallocating
metadata block groups. This results in filesystems becoming read-only
even though there is plenty of "free" space.

This patch adds the ability to query and set the metadata allocation
size.

  Patch 1: btrfs: store chunk size in space-info struct.
    Store the stripe and chunk size in the btrfs_space_info structure
    to be able to expose and set the metadata allocation size.
    
  Patch 2: btrfs: expose chunk size in sysfs.
    Add a sysfs entry to read and write the above information.
    
  btrfs: add force_chunk_alloc sysfs entry to force allocation
    For testing purposes and under a debug flag add a sysfs entry to
    force a space allocation.


Stefan Roesch (3):
  btrfs: store chunk size in space-info struct.
  btrfs: expose chunk size in sysfs.
  btrfs: add force_chunk_alloc sysfs entry to force allocation
