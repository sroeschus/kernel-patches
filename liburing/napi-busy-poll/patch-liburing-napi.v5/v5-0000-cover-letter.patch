Subject: [PATCH v5 0/4] liburing: add api for napi busy poll

This adds two new api's to set/clear the napi busy poll settings. The two
new functions are called:
- io_uring_register_napi
- io_uring_unregister_napi

The patch series also contains the documentation for the two new functions
and two example programs. The client program is called napi-busy-poll-client
and the server program napi-busy-poll-server. The client measures the
roundtrip times of requests.

There is also a kernel patch "io-uring: support napi busy poll" to enable
this feature on the kernel side.

Changes:
- V5:
  - Fixes to documentation.
  - Correct opcode for unregister call
  - Initialize napi structure in example programs
  - Address tab issues in recordRTT()
- V4:
  - Modify functions to use a structure to pass the napi busy poll settings
    to the kernel.
  - Return previous values when returning from the above functions.
  - Rename the functions and remove one function (no longer needed as the
    data is passed as a structure)
- V3:
  - Updated liburing.map file
  - Moved example programs from the test directory to the example directory.
    The two example programs don't fit well in the test category and need to
    be run from separate hosts.
  - Added the io_uring_register_napi_prefer_busy_poll API.
  - Added the call to io_uring_register_napi_prefer_busy_poll to the example
    programs
  - Updated the documentation
- V2:
  - Updated the liburing.map file for the two new functions.
    (added a 2.4 section)
  - Added a description of the new feature to the changelog file
  - Fixed the indentation of the longopts structure
  - Used defined exit constants
  - Fixed encodeUserData to support 32 bit builds
