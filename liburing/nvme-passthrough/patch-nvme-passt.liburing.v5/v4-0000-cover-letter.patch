Subject: [PATCH v4 0/6]liburing: add support for large CQE sizes

This adds support for large CQE sizes in the liburing layer. The large CQE
sizes double the size compared to the default CQE size.

To support larger CQE sizes the mmap call needs to be modified to map a larger
memory region for large CQE's. For default CQE's the size of the mapping stays
the same.
Also the ring size calculation needs to change.

Finally when large CQE's are indexed, they need to take into account the bigger
CQE size. The index manipulation remains unchanged, only when the CQE array is
accessed, the offset is changed for large CQE's.

The nop test has been modified to test that the new values are set correctly.

Testing:
The liburing test suite has been run with the four different configurations:
- default
- large SQE
- large CQE
- large SQE & large CQE
To do this the default setting has been changed for the test run to the above
values.:

To use these changes, also the corresponding kernel changes are required.


Changes:
  V2: the changed kernel definition of io_uring_cqe_extra has been applied to
      the first patch in this patch series.
  V3: - change definition of extra io_uring_cqe fields like in linux kernel
      - remove io_uring_cqe_extra definition
  V4: change nop test to use new field names


Stefan Roesch (6):
  liburing: Update io_uring.h with large CQE kernel changes
  liburing: increase mmap size for large CQE's
  liburing: return correct ring size for large CQE's
  liburing: index large CQE's correctly
  liburing: add large CQE tests to nop test
  liburing: Test all configurations with NOP test
