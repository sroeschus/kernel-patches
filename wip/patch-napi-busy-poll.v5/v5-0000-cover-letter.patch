Subject: [PATCH v5 0/3] io_uring: add napi busy polling support 

This adds the napi busy polling support in io_uring.c. It adds a new
napi_list to the io_ring_ctx structure. This list contains the list of
napi_id's that are currently enabled for busy polling. This list is
used to determine which napi id's enabled busy polling.

io-uring allows specifying two parameters:
- busy poll timeout and
- prefer busy poll to call of io_napi_busy_loop()
This sets the above parameters for the ring. The settings are passed
with a new structure io_uring_napi.

There is also a corresponding liburing patch series, which enables this
feature. The name of the series is "liburing: add add api for napi busy
poll timeout". It also contains two programs to test the this.

Testing has shown that the round-trip times are reduced to 38us from
55us by enabling napi busy polling with a busy poll timeout of 100us.
More detailled results are part of the commit message of the first
patch.


Changes:
- V5:
  - Refreshed to 6.1-rc6
  - Use copy_from_user instead of memdup/kfree
  - Removed the moving of napi_busy_poll_to
  - Return -EINVAL if any of the reserved or padded fields are not 0.
- V4:
  - Pass structure for napi config, instead of individual parameters
- V3:
  - Refreshed to 6.1-rc5
  - Added a new io-uring api for the prefer napi busy poll api and wire
    it to io_napi_busy_loop().
  - Removed the unregister (implemented as register)
  - Added more performance results to the first commit message.
- V2:
  - Add missing defines if CONFIG_NET_RX_BUSY_POLL is not defined
  - Changes signature of function io_napi_add_list to static inline
    if CONFIG_NET_RX_BUSY_POLL is not defined
  - define some functions as static
