Subject: [RFC PATCH v1 00/19] mm: process/cgroup ksm support

So far KSM can only be enabled by calling madvise for memory regions. What is
required to enable KSM for more workloads is to enable / disable it at the
process / cgroup level.

1. New options for prctl system command
This patch series adds two new options to the prctl system call. The first
one allows to enable KSM at the process level and the second one to query the
setting.

The setting will be inherited by child processes.

With the above setting, KSM can be enabled for the seed process of a cgroup
and all processes in the cgroup will inherit the setting.

2. Changes to KSM processing
When KSM is enabled at the process level, the KSM code will iterate over all
the VMA's and enable KSM for the eligible VMA's.

When forking a process that has KSM enabled, the setting will be inherited by
the new child process.

In addition when KSM is disabled for a process, KSM will be disabled for the
VMA's where KSM has been enabled.

3. Add tracepoints to KSM
Currently KSM has no tracepoints. This adds tracepoints to the key KSM functions
to make it easier to debug KSM.

4. Add general_profit metric
The general_profit metric of KSM is specified in the documentation, but not
calculated. This adds the general profit metric to /sys/kernel/debug/mm/ksm.

5. Add more metrics to ksm_stat
This adds the process profit and ksm type metric to /proc/<pid>/ksm_stat.

6. Add more tests to ksm_tests
This adds an option to specify the merge type to the ksm_tests. This allows to
test madvise and prctl KSM. It also adds a new option to query if prctl KSM has
been enabled. It adds a fork test to verify that the KSM process setting is
inherited by client processes.

TODO:
Document the new sysfs knob and the new ksm_stat metrics.
