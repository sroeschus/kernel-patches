Subject: [PATCH v1 0/4] Add large CQE support for io-uring

This adds the large CQE support for io-uring. Large CQE's are 16 bytes longer.
To support the longer CQE's the allocation part is changed and when the CQE is
accessed.

The allocation of the large CQE's is twice as big, so the allocation size is
doubled.

All accesses to the large CQE's need to be shifted by 1 to take the bigger size
of each CQE into account. The exisiting index manipulation does not need to be
changed and can stay the same.

The code for overflows needs to be adapted accordingly: the allocation needs to
take large CQE's into account. This means that the order of the fields in the io
overflow structure needs to be changed and the allocation needs to be enlarged
for big CQE's.
In addition the two new fields need to be copied for large CQE's.

Testing:

The exisiting tests have been run with the following configurations and they all
pass:

- Default config
- Large SQE
- Large CQE
- Large SQE and large CQE.

Note:
To use this patch also the corresponding changes to the client library
liburing are required. A different patch series is sent out for this.


Stefan Roesch (4):
  uring: Modify io_get_cqe for large CQE's
  uring: Re-order io_overflow_cqe fields
  uring: Allocate correct size in overflow structure for large CQE's
  uring: initialize new fields for large CQE's in overflow struct
