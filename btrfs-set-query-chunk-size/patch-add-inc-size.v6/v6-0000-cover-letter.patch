Subject: [PATCH v6 0/4] btrfs: sysfs: set / query btrfs chunk size

The btrfs allocator is currently not ideal for all workloads. It tends
to suffer from overallocating data block groups and underallocating
metadata block groups. This results in filesystems becoming read-only
even though there is plenty of "free" space.

This is naturally confusing and distressing to users.

Patches:
1) Store the chunk size in the btrfs_space_info structure
2) Add a sysfs entry to read and write the above information
3) Add a sysfs entry to force a space allocation
4) Increase the default size of the metadata chunk allocation to 5GB
   for volumes greater than 50GB.

Testing:
  A new test is being added to the xfstest suite. For reference the
  corresponding patch has the title:
    [PATCH] btrfs: Test chunk allocation with different sizes

  In addition also manual testing has been performed.
    - Run xfstests with the changes and the new test. It does not
      show new diffs.
    - Test with storage devices 10G, 20G, 30G, 50G, 60G
      - Default allocation
      - Increase of chunk size
      - If the stripe size is > the free space, it allocates
        free space - 1MB. The 1MB is left as free space.
      - If the device has a storage size > 50G, it uses a 5GB
        chunk size for new allocations.

---
v6: - Update btrfs_force_chunk_alloc_store to use tree_root
      instead of extent_root.
V5: - Changed the field name in the btrfs_space_info struct from
      default_chunk_size to chunk_size and made it atomic
    - Removed the compute_chunk_size_zoned function
    - Added further checks when writing /sys/fs/btrfs/<id>/allocation/<type>/chunk_size
    - Removed the ability to query /sys/fs/btrfs/<id>/allocation/<type>/force_alloc_chunk

V4: - Patch email contained duplicate entries.

V3: - Rename sysfs entry from stripe_size to chunk_size
    - Remove max_chunk_size field in data structure btrfs_space_info
    - Rename max_stripe_size field to default_chunk_size in data
      structure btrfs_space_info
    - Remove max_chunk_size logic
    - Use stripe_size = chunk_size

V2:
   - Split the patch in 4 patches
   - Added checks for zone volumes in sysfs.c
   - Replaced the BUG() with ASSERT()
   - Changed if with fallthrough
   - Removed comments in space-info.h
